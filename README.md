# Diabetic-retinopathy-Diesease-Detection
Diabetic retinopathy Diesease Detection
a machine learning approach to detect diabetic retinopathy from retinal images which is one of the most common diseases among diabetic patient. In our experiment, Inception v3 is used as the machine learning approach. Inception is a convolutional neural network classifier by Google. The dataset is collected from Kaggle which contains images of five categories. kNN algorithm  shall be adopted for the purpose of prediction. Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness among working-age adults. Diabetic retinopathy is a disease caused by Diabetes that effects the eyes of the patients. This disease affects blood vessels in the retina. Almost 75% of patients who have diabetes for a long time are affected by this disease.Initially patient can have a minor vision problem but eventually, this can cause blindness.
